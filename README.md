# Fork of Olauncher with 10 launchers on the homescreen
This is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) which I forked for personal use.

It patched the launcher to now contain up to 10 apps on the homescreen.
Feel free to use it but I won't keep updating it regularly.



## Olauncher | Minimal AF
Olauncher is a minimal launcher app for Android. AF stands for Ad-Free. It can also update your wallpaper daily, if you want.
